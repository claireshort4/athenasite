CV

Claire Short is a researcher with a passion for artificial intelligence and neuroscience, taking inspiration from biological systems to drive hypotheses to research questions in AI safety. She has taken part in multiple research and artist residencies, work in data science, operations at the Atlas Fellowship, is a Neurotech Fellow at Foresight, and participated in SERI MATS - an AI safety research fellowship. Her neuroscience research experience includes behavioral work in animal models studying impulsive decision-making, work in brain simulation software, and EEG studies in humans with the aim of uncovering neural correlates of specific meditation states. Beyond research she enjoys the connection between machines and the human mind in art, using EEG data and hand drawn ‘scientific’ diagrams as a tool and medium to uncover human emotions in a new light.
