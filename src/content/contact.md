Claire Short is a researcher with a passion for artificial intelligence and neuroscience, taking inspiration from biological systems to drive hypotheses to research questions in AI alignment. She has taken part in multiple research and artist residencies, research in neuroscience involving impulsive decision-making, brain simulation software, and EEG meditation studies, as well as work in data science, operations at the Atlas Fellowship, Neurotech Fellow at Foresight, and participated as a research scholar at SERI MATS - an AI alignment research fellowship. Beyond research she enjoys the connection between machines and the human mind in art, using EEG data and hand drawn diagrams as a tool and medium to uncover human emotions in a new light.
