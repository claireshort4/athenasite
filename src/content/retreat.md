## Athena Retreat 2024
In February 2024, Athena fellows, staff, speakers, and coaches spent five days together in Oxford to participate in a compact seminar program. Speakers from organizations including Apollo Research, Aligned AI, PIBBSS, Foresight Institute, GPI, and Cooperative AI Foundation met with mentees to share their research agendas and guidance for the mentees.

Athena fellows also had the opportunities to book office hours with speakers and staff; book sessions with the in-house career coach, Katie Glass; meet with one another for pair debugging and collaboration; and hone presentation skills through delivering their own presentations.

During allotted downtime, fellows enjoyed meditation, painting, hikes through the woods, and exploring Oxford (Windsor, Ashmolean, etc.).

### Retreat Seminar
