### Program Structure
1-week in-person retreat in Oxford, UK followed by a 2-month remote mentorship by established researchers in the field, with networking and weekly research talks. 

Athena aims to equip women with the knowledge, skills, and network they need to thrive in AI alignment research. We believe that diversity is a strength, and hope to see this program as a stepping stone towards a more diverse and inclusive AI safety research field.

This program is designed to offer mentorship opportunities to technically qualified women who are early in their AI alignment research careers or looking to transition into the field by connecting them with experienced mentors, resources to upskill, networking, and a supportive community. 

The remote mentorship program begins on Jan 15 and ends on March 15. The in-person retreat will occur during the week of Jan 15th, or mid-Feburary depending on availbility of the cohort. We ask that you devote at least 20 hours per week to the program, but working schedules can be discussed with your mentor.
